    <p style="font-size: 70px;"> In addition to diet other words or phrases are used to identify and describe these
        foods including light, zero calorie, low calorie, low fat, no fat and sugar free. In some areas use of these
        terms may be regulated by law. For example, in the U.S. a product labeled as "low fat" must not contain more
        than 3 grams of fat per serving; and to be labeled "fat free" it must contain less than 0.5 grams of fat per
        serving</p>
    <p>Process

        The process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an adequate low-food-energy substitute
        for some high-food-energy ingredient.[2] This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's sugar with
        a sugar substitute as is common with diet soft drinks such as Coca-Cola (for example Diet Coke). In some snacks,
        the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat ingredients may be
        used as replacements
        In whole grain foods, the high fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour.
        Since certain kinds of fibers have no food energy, this results in a moderate energy reduction. Another process
        relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as resistant starch or dietary
        fiber, to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction. </p>

<h2>BOOST UP CREATINE </h2>
<p>Creatine (/ˈkriːətiːn/ or /ˈkriːətɪn/)[1] is an organic compound with the nominal formula (H2N)(HN)CN(CH3)CH2CO2H. It
    exists in various modifications (tautomers) in solution. Creatine is found in vertebrates where it facilitates
    recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), primarily in muscle and brain tissue. Recycling is achieved by converting
    adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP via donation of phosphate groups. Creatine also acts as a buffer </p>

    Metabolic role
    Creatine is a naturally occurring non-protein compound of which the primary metabolic role is to combine creatine
    with a phosphoryl group to generate phosphocreatine, which is used to regenerate ATP or adenosine triphosphate. Most
    of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle (95%), while the
    remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, testes, and other tissues.[16][17] The average amount of total
    creatine (creatine and phosphocreatine) stored in the body is approximately 120 mmol/kg of dry muscle mass.[18]
    However, the upper limit of creatine storage post supplementation and dietary intervention is believed to be around
    160 mmol/kg.[18] Studies have also shown that 1–2% of intramuscular creatine is degraded per day and an individual
    would need to consume about 1–3 grams of creatine per day to maintain average (unsupplemented) creatine
    storage.[18][19][20] For most individuals about half (1 g/day) of this daily need is consumed from an omnivorous
    diet,[21][17] while the remaining amount is synthesized in the liver and kidne
